/**
 * Turn one-shot `release-uptake.mjs --json` output into a DURABLE, committed
 * time series — so "did the uptake curve move?" is answerable from the repo
 * instead of from whoever happened to run the script that week.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `release-uptake.mjs` answers "what is the gated share right now". AGE-111 asks
 * a different question: "is it RISING". Answering that needs datapoints taken
 * days apart, and the way that was being done — an agent wakes up, runs the
 * script with a local Sentry token, pastes the output into a ticket comment —
 * fails in three specific ways:
 *
 *   1. The token is a GitHub secret. An agent measuring locally may not have it,
 *      and pasted terminal output is not a series anyone can re-derive.
 *   2. Sentry release health only retains a 90d window. A datapoint not written
 *      down when it is taken is gone. The baseline this issue depends on
 *      (2026-08-14, tag day) cannot be recovered later at all.
 *   3. A missed week silently becomes a hole in the curve, and a hole is
 *      indistinguishable from "flat" when you are trying to prove movement.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 * ------------
 * Merges the DAILY series (not the 7d average) into a keyed-by-date store.
 * Three consequences of that choice, all deliberate:
 *
 *   - SELF-HEALING. Each run carries the trailing 7 days, so a run that does not
 *     happen costs nothing as long as another lands within 7 days. Missed runs
 *     backfill instead of leaving holes.
 *   - REVISABLE TODAY. The datapoint for the day a run happens is incomplete —
 *     the day is still accumulating sessions. It is stored `partial: true` and
 *     overwritten by any later observation. Trend math ignores partial points,
 *     because a half-finished day reads as a dip that isn't there.
 *   - THE AVERAGE LIES EARLY. A trailing-7d average on rollout day is ~6/7
 *     pre-rollout data. The daily series turned off 0.0% the same day the 7d
 *     average still read 1.0%. Grading a rollout on the average punishes it for
 *     the week before it existed.
 *
 * Cohort snapshots (per run: gated share, largest ungated cohort) are kept
 * alongside, because "gated share up" and "the stale cohort shrank" are two
 * different claims and a rollout can show the first without the second.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/release-uptake.mjs --json --days 7 > report.json
 *   node scripts/uptake-series.mjs --in report.json --write     # merge + persist
 *   node scripts/uptake-series.mjs --markdown                   # render the curve
 *   ... --file docs/metrics/release-uptake.json                 # store location
 *   ... --baseline 2026-08-14                                   # trend anchor
 *
 * Reads the report from stdin when --in is absent. Exit code 0 for any readable
 * result: a flat curve is a finding, not a crash.
